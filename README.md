Combining Instaloader & YOLOv5

Hey everyone! I've been diving into a project that marries the scraping capabilities of Instaloader with the object detection prowess of YOLOv5. So far, I've managed to get the Instaloader part up and running. The idea is to fetch posts from Instagram profiles and then sift through these images using YOLOv5 to identify and analyze specific objects within them. Here's what I have and where I'm hoping to go with this:
What's Done

    Instaloader Script: I've set up a script using Instaloader to log into Instagram, download posts from a specified profile, and save them locally. This includes images, captions, and some metadata. It's a neat way to gather the data I need for the next part of the project.

The Goal

    YOLOv5 Integration: The next step is to feed these downloaded images into YOLOv5's detect.py script to analyze the images for specific objects. I'm envisioning this as a way to automate content analysis on a large scale, potentially identifying trends, objects, or themes across different Instagram profiles.

Challenges & Questions

    I'm currently scratching my head on the best way to bridge these two tools. Ideally, there would be a seamless flow from downloading the images to analyzing them without manual intervention. I'm thinking about a script that can call YOLOv5's detection capabilities right after the download completes. Any insights or advice on this would be super appreciated!

How You Can Help

    If you've worked with either Instaloader or YOLOv5 (especially in tandem), I'd love to hear about your experiences.
    Tips on managing the workflow between these tools, especially around automating the process from image download to object detection.
    Any code snippets, GitHub repos, or resources that you think might help bridge the gap between downloading content with Instaloader and analyzing it with YOLOv5.

I'm all ears for suggestions, guidance, or even potential collaboration opportunities. Let's make this idea a reality!
